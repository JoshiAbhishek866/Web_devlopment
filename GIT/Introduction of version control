diff Command: 
diff is used to find differences between two files. On its own, itâ€™s a bit hard to use; instead, use it with diff -u to find lines which differ in two files:
Example of dii:
diff -u oldfile newfile > change.diff
//here ">" symbol will generate file change.diff from getting difference between old and new
// and this generated file is called patch file  

diff -u is used to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output. See below:
Example : 
~$ cat menu1.txt 
Menu1:
Apples
Bananas
Oranges
Pears

~$ cat menu2.txt 
Menu:
Apples
Bananas
Grapes
Strawberries

~$ diff -u menu1.txt menu2.txt

Patch command: 
Patch takes a file generated by diff and applies changes to original one 
Eg 
patch cpu_usage.py < cpu_usage.diff  => output: patching file cpu_usage.py
//this means  changes will apply from cpu_usage.diff to cpu_usage.py
//thus while diff is the command that generates the difference between two files, patch is the command that applies those differences to the original file.
sys.exit will cause exit of program
